Building
--------

0. If "configure" is missing from the top level directory, you
   probably retrieved this code directly from the repository.
   Run "./bootstrap".

   If your versions of the autotools are not new enough to run
   this script, download and official tarball in which the
   configure script is already provided.

1. Run "./configure --prefix=/INSTALL_DIR"

   See "./configure --help" for configuration options.

2. Run "make"

4. Optionally, run "make install".  The installation prefix
   can be changed as an option to the "configure" script.

Testing
-------

1. Enter to test directory
   
   cd tests 
   ./create_test
   make check
